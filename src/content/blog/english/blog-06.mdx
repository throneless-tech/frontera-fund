A library serves no purpose unless someone is using it. Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein, Kazanga or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, 'Today I will be brilliant.' Curious, how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want. To Boldly Go Where No Man Has Gone Before... Resistance Is Futile! 

Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on. Madness has no purpose. Or reason. But it may have a goal. They used to say that if Man was meant to fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. Live Long and Prosper. 

### Challenge & Solution [.text-h3]

Look at these three words written larger than all the rest, and with special pride never written before or since -- tall words, proudly saying "We the people" ... these words and the words that follow ... must apply to everyone or they mean nothing. I’ve done far worse than kill you. …I’ve hurt you; and I intend to go on… hurting you. I will leave you as you left me; as you left her. Marooned for all eternity at the center of a dead planet. …Buried alive; buried alive…. 

## Final Result [.text-h3]

Compassion: that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Curious, how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want. We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human -- and maybe that's the word that best explains us.
