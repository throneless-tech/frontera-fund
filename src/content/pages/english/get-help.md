**For information on abortions in Texas [click here](https://needabortion.org/). To jump down to our resources list, [click here](#resources).**

Frontera Fund provides financial and practical support for those from the Rio Grande Valley and Texas border community seeking reproductive healthcare.

To qualify for funding, a caller must reside within 100 miles of the Texas/Mexico border.

## What can I expect from the funding process?

Frontera Fund will contact you and ask you a few questions to determine how much funding you qualify for. Once funding has been awarded, Frontera Fund will send a voucher to the clinic with your name and appointment information indicating how much funding you are receiving.
 

Frontera Fund does not have the capacity to fund 100% of reproductive health care costs and typically funds anywhere from $100 – $600, depending on services. If you are still in need of financial assistance, you can contact the funds below.

**Disclaimer: Frontera Fund affirms that it has always complied, and is presently complying, with Texas law. While Frontera Fund does offer funding for abortion services, it only does so when the abortion takes place outside of Texas in a state where abortion is legal.**

*Frontera Fund does not sell or distribute medication abortion.*
